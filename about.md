Hey, I am Guangpu, a research scientist working on Machine Learning, Neural Models, and Speech Recognition. My research centers around Recurrent Neural Network, and its applications in language modeling, text data augmentation, and speech recognition.

On a side enjoy traveling, jogging, drawing, and trying to maintain an active Github account. Cheers.
