**Bio.** I am Guangpu, a research scientist working on human language technologies.

My research focuses on studying the parallelism between the human speech production and perception processes to improve the performance of computer based systems.  
I apply the production and perception features in challenging tasks, such as speech inversion, speech recognition, text data augmentation, and language understanding.

On a side enjoy traveling, jogging, drawing, and trying to maintain an active Github account.
