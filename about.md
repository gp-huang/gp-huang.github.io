Hey, I am Guangpu, a research scientist working on Speech Recognition.

My research centers around Recurrent Neural Network, and its applications in language modeling, text data augmentation, and speech recognition.

On a side enjoy traveling, jogging, drawing, and trying to maintain an active Github account. Cheers.
